## Simple Calculator Project

### Overview
This project is a simple calculator implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The goal of this project is to practice coding skills and gain a deeper understanding of web development.

### Project Structure
- `simpleCalculator.html`: HTML file containing the calculator layout and structure.
- `simpleCalculator.css`: CSS file for styling the calculator layout.
- `simpleCalculator.js`: JavaScript file implementing the calculator functionality.

### Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Markup language for creating the structure of the calculator.
- **CSS**: Styling language for designing the appearance of the calculator.
- **JavaScript**: A programming language for implementing the calculator's functionality.

### Setup and Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `simpleCalculator.html` file in a web browser to view the calculator.
3. Use the calculator buttons to perform arithmetic operations.

### Future Enhancements
- Add support for more advanced operations (e.g., exponentiation, square root).
- Improve the user interface with animations and transitions.
- Implement keyboard support for typing numbers and performing operations.

## Passport Login System with Express.js and EJS

### Overview
User authentication and login are crucial features for many websites. This project focuses on building a secure user login system using Express.js and EJS (Embedded JavaScript) for templating. Express.js provides the server-side framework, while EJS helps in generating dynamic HTML pages with embedded JavaScript code.

### Project Structure
- `server.js`: Main file to configure and start the Express.js server.
- `views/`: Directory containing EJS templates (`index.ejs`, `login.ejs`, `register.ejs`).

### Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building the server-side application.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js to create server-side functionality.
- **EJS (Embedded JavaScript)**: Templating language for generating HTML with embedded JavaScript.

### Setup and Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Start the server using `node server.js`.
4. Access the application via `http://localhost:3000`.

### Future Enhancements
- Implement additional authentication strategies (e.g., OAuth, JWT).
- Add user profile management and password reset functionality.
- Enhance security measures with rate limiting and account lockout policies.
- Integrate frontend frameworks (e.g., React, Angular) for a more interactive user experience.
